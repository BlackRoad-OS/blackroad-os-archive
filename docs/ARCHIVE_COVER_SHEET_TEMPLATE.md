## Writing guidance
- **Narrative**: Describe what the project is and who uses it.
- **History**: Capture why it was created and any major shifts or rewrites.
- **Current Role**: Explain how it fits the constellation today (deps, clients, surfaces).
- **Why it matters**: Spell out the unique value so stakeholders know why to keep it healthy.
- **Risk if lost**: List what would break or become slower/harder to rebuild.
- **Recommended action**: Choose from `keep-live`, `snapshot`, `deprecate`, `merge` and note any blocking steps.
