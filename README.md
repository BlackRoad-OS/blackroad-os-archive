# 🧾 blackroad-os-archive

> **Memory Vault 📡 — Append-only archive for deploy logs, beacon maps, ping history, and key system artifacts, served via archive.blackroad.io**

---

## 🎯 Mission

`blackroad-os-archive` is the **immutable memory** of the BlackRoad OS ecosystem. It serves to:

- 🧾 **Store logs, snapshots, and artifacts** so we can always reconstruct "what happened when"
- 📡 **Feed Prism/Operator/Agents** with trustworthy historical data
- 🏛️ **Be the institutional memory** — a calm, ordered space where 10,000 agents can answer "what happened when, and why?"

Think of it as the **Library of Alexandria for BlackRoad OS** 🕯️💚

---

## 🏗️ What This Repo Owns (✅)

### 🧾 Append-Only History
- **Deploy logs** — what shipped, when, from where, by whom/which agent 🚀
- **System pings & health snapshots** — uptime, latency, status over time 📡
- **Beacon maps** — which services/envs/orgs are alive + reachable 🗺️

### 📦 Artifacts
- **Key system snapshots** — config exports, schema snapshots, diagrams 📸
- **Important reports** — incident postmortems, infra audits, upgrade notes 📑
- **Serialized state bundles** — "state at time T" snapshots where needed 🧬

### 📡 Archive Feeds
Streams that other systems can read:
- **Prism Console dashboards** 🕹️
- **Operator workflows** (trend-aware decisions) ⚙️
- **Research/analytics** (latency, failure patterns) 🧪

### 🔍 Query & Indexing (Lightweight)
- Index by time, env, service, region, incident ID where possible ⏱️
- Simple APIs/paths for "list artifacts for X day/week/incident" 🧭

## 🧪 Invariants (VERY IMPORTANT)

### Archive is **APPEND-ONLY**
- ✅ New entries can be added
- ✅ Corrections are new entries that *reference* old ones
- 🚫 Existing history is not silently edited or deleted

### Every Record Must Have
- 🧬 A **stable ID**
- ⏱️ A **precise timestamp** (with timezone/UTC)
- 🧭 **Context tags** (env, service, org, incident, agent if applicable)

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

### Data here may be **compliance-relevant**:
- ⚖️ Treat as audit-grade: logs must be trustworthy
- 🔐 No secrets (passwords, raw tokens, private keys) 🚫
- 🧼 Avoid sensitive PII; use opaque IDs where possible

### For finance/identity/compliance-critical events:
Tag clearly, e.g.: `// COMPLIANCE-SENSITIVE ARCHIVE RECORD`

**No Secrets Policy:**
- ❌ No API keys, tokens, passwords
- ❌ No database credentials
- ❌ No private keys or certificates
- ✅ Only clean, text-based documentation

---

## 📏 Design Principles

`blackroad-os-archive` = **"what happened"**, not "what should happen":
- 🧭 This is history, not business logic
- 🧾 Prefer explicit, structured formats over free-text blobs

Every artifact/log format should answer:
1. ⏱️ **When** did this happen?
2. 🧭 **What** system/env/service/agent did it involve?
3. 🧬 **What is the minimum data** needed to reconstruct the event?

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Browsing:
1. Start with [`catalog/INDEX.md`](catalog/INDEX.md) - Master index
2. Check [`catalog/timeline.md`](catalog/timeline.md) - Chronological view
3. Browse [`snapshots/`](snapshots/) - Point-in-time captures

### For Contributing:
1. Read [`meta/ARCHIVE_COVER_SHEET.md`](meta/ARCHIVE_COVER_SHEET.md) - What this archive is
2. Review [`meta/CONTRIBUTING.md`](meta/CONTRIBUTING.md) - How to contribute
3. Check [`workflows/`](workflows/) - Process documentation

### For AI Agents:
1. Read [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md) - Your system prompt
2. Review workflows in [`workflows/`](workflows/)
3. Follow the pre-commit checklist before making changes

## 🔁 How It Works

### Archival Process:
```
Draft (Source Repo) → Review → Archive → Canonical Status
```

1. Content is created and finalized in source repos (research, docs, infra)
2. Label applied: `Status: Ready for Archive`
3. Archive copy created with metadata header
4. Indexes updated, PR created and reviewed
5. Merged - now canonical reference version

### Snapshot Process:
```
Monthly/Milestone → Capture State → Document → Archive
```

1. Snapshot triggered (monthly, milestone, or on-demand)
2. Ecosystem state captured (orgs, repos, infra, IP)
3. Context and changes documented
4. Snapshot archived with full metadata

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

If a human/agent is debugging something scary and lands here, they should be able to:

1. 🔍 **Reconstruct the sequence** of key events around a deploy/incident
2. 📸 **See how the system looked** (services, health, configs) at a specific point in time
3. 📊 **Feed Prism/Operator/Research** with reliable historical data without guessing
