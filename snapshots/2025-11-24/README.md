# Snapshot: 2025-11-24

**Snapshot Type:** Milestone  
**Initiated By:** agent:github-copilot  
**Reason:** Archive initialization and baseline ecosystem capture  
**Related Events:** Initial setup of blackroad-os-archive repository

---

## Summary

This is the **initial snapshot** of the BlackRoad OS ecosystem, captured at the moment of archive repository initialization. This snapshot serves as:

- **Baseline:** The starting point for all future snapshots and comparisons
- **Documentation:** Initial state of the ecosystem as the archive system comes online
- **Foundation:** The first entry in the long-term memory system of BlackRoad OS

At this moment, the BlackRoad OS Archive infrastructure is being established, including the complete workflow system, catalog structure, and metadata standards that will govern all future archival activities.

This snapshot captures what is known about the ecosystem at initialization time, with the understanding that some repositories and services may exist but are not yet fully documented.
